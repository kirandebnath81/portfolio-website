        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            After living 17 years of my life, in the 18th year of my life i have discovered the secret to lead a beautiful,
            happy and successful life.Death is the end destination of everyone and one day we all have have to die ,its the
            bitter truth of life.But it's not the death day when we are actually dying and leaving our body permanantly,its
            each and every moment we are dying ,only difference is we are not leaving our body.Is that confusing you ,ohk
            wait let me break it down.
        <p>I believe there is two kinds of death <span>Permanant Death</span> and <span>Time Death.</span>
            You know about the first one,where we die permanantly.But what happens in <span>Time Death</span>
            ,here we are dying every moment.Once we live any moment of our life we cannot go back to that moment again.I
            mean our past is past it can not be relived again in our present, whatever time is spent it is died for
            permanantly.Our each and every moment spent is died for permanantly.Thus, it is not wrong to say every moment we
            are dying because our time is dying.So, what should be the best way of living your life, there are some tips
            which i believe, if followed life would be happy, satisfying and successful.
    
        <h1>One day as if one life</h1>
        <p>Living everyday as if the whole life will make your every single day one of the best days of your life.If you
            wake up early in the morning realising you have only this day to live then you will not stuck into the trap of
            bad habits and wasting your time rather your only focus will how can you make this day as the best day and the most
            memorable day of your life.</p>
    
        <h1>Following Your heart</h1>
        <p>Knowing you have only this day to live , you are going to do everything that you could never even imagine to do
            in a normal day.Your soul will push you as hard as possible.Challenge yourself every single moment of the day
            and give your 100% effort at every moment .Let the every moment of your life to die with utmost satifaction</p>
    
        <h1>Satisfaction</h1>
        <p>We want Satisfaction in our life but very few actually gets.But if you believe you have one day to live then your
            only purpose will be to finish this day with utmost satifaction.Throughout the day you will only do the things
            that your hearts wants to do and your heart knows doing that you will get satisfied. </p>
    
        <h1>At your death bed</h1>
        <p>If someone ask you, how you want to feel in the last few seconds of your life,well i don't know about you but i
            want to feel happy, satisfied ,no regretment and achieved everything i wanted to achieve.The same rule you can
            apply to time death as well,believing that at the end of every day you are going to die, you set all goals at
            the start of your day and throughout the day give out everything to achieve the goals.This way your everyday
            will be like a life and you will live your life to the fullest.
        </p>
    <h1>Success</h1>
    <p>We all set the purpose of our  life, achieving those purpose we call it as success.As a thousand rupees is the addition of  every single one rupee coin or a ocean is formed with every single drop of water, similarly success is the result of your every single day's hardwork.If you break your dream or purpose in small parts as if the drops of water and divide it in every single day and having the belief that this is the only day of your life , you give out everything to make your small dream come true.This way one day will come when all the drops of water will merge together to make the ocean, i mean to realise your purpose of life</p>
