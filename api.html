        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, friends before start reading my blog , i would like to inform you that i am not a regular blogger .I tried it for the second time so,if i do any mistakes then forgive me and and fell free to point it out, so that i can <span>improve my writing.</span> 
        <h1>Defination</h1>
        <h1>What is api?</h1>
        <p>Lets not take the internet defination, it's not beginner's friendly. <span>Let's start</span> so, api stands for <span>Application programming interface,</span>which means its an interface ,which allows two programs to talk to each other.I mean by writing some program you can talk to other program.

            <h1>Deep </h1>
            When you  book plain tickets of Indigo or any other flight company then you use makemytrip or any other site but you rarely book it from the actual flight company site.This is possible because of api,so how this works? If Indiga company has all the data about no. seats available,how many sold,list of passengers ,and everything all,then how this other companies book the ticket? so, here the api of indigo helps the other companies to talk to the server of the Indigo company.Api works as an third party,like no company will give the full access of their serveer so they make api and api give the data to the other companies but only to the extend of requirement.All the  industry works like his way if anyone wants to use any data or interact with other server they do it through the api of respective servers .
            
           <h1>Real Life example.</h1>
<p>You go to a resturant, the waiter comes takes your order and serve you food.You interact with the waiter for whatever you need and waiter responses to your order and gives you as per avilibility.But you never see the chief to take the order.The same thing happens in the internet world.Here the waiter is the api and the chief is the server.You cannot interact with server like chief, you have to say your request to the api like waiter.Api will go to the server and tell your request and return you what you ask</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
